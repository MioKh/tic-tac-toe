# tic-tac-toe
A tic tac toe game using JS and trying to optimize the code as most as possible 

So i have no idea how to even start So i'll start by identifying what we need since the goal here , and on forward to write clean code and make it readable by anyone 

0 input names for players ( idk about the ai its for later);
1 make the board  we need to first make the board as they said make it a array in a object
2 render the board 
3 take input from the user 
4 update the board according to what input the user did 
5 : switch players and maybe like i could keep track of how many grids are used and when it hits 0;
6 check for a winner , somehow idk 
7 display result whearther its a win or a tie 
8 restart the game 

i guess that's it I'll try to work it out one by one and see if any problems come up and write them here
